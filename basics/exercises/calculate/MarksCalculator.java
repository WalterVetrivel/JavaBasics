//        Import Scanner and create a scanner instance
//        You need to calculate the total marks of a student in a unit
//        The unit has 2 assignments, assignment 1 & assignment 2
//        Each assignment has a maximum mark of 15 and the weight of each assignment is 10% of total unit mark
//        There is a mid-semester exam that has a maximum mark of 25 and it weights 25% of total unit mark
//        The final exam has a maximum mark of 60 and the weight is 55% of the total unit mark
//        Get the marks for assignment 1, assignment 2, mid-semester exam and final exam from the user
//        Then calculate the weighted mark for each of the assessment items
//        You can store the weights and maximum marks in separate variables
//        Use floats for the weights, eg., for the assignment worth 10%, you can use a variable like float assignment1Weight = 0.1f;
//        For the maximum marks, you can use integer variables
//        For everything else, use double
//        To calculate weighted mark, you can use the formula weightedMark = (actualMark / maxMark) * weight
//        This needs to be applied for each assessment item to get weighted marks for 2 assignments, a mid-semester exam and a final exam
//        Finally, add the weighted marks together and multiply the result by 100
